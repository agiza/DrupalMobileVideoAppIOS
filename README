Mobile Video App for iOS
=======================
* Based on using the Octopus Video distribution (http://octopusvideo.org/) for Drupal
* Update everything to the latest versions of the module
* Install Services and Services Views
* Enable Services, Services Views, and REST Server modules
* Create a new Services REST resource called "REST"
* Enable session authentication
* Allow access to node, file, user, and views
* You will need to turn on "Image Allow Insecure Derivatives" so that the mobile app can create images with ImageCache
* Edit the app's AppData.m to set up your server's host name

* The app uses CocoaPods, so you will need to do "pod install" to get set up.
